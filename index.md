My name is Kh√°nh, but I also roll with Kan, or Khanh, or Khan.

I [cook](https://www.instagram.com/food.with.kan/), [photograph](https://www.instagram.com/photos.with.kan/), [blog](https://blog.ngkan.me), bouldering and much more.

In my past life I did competitive programming and got some memorable [achievements](https://cphof.org/profile/codeforces:ngkan). Occasionally I put cool things [here](https://cp-wiki.ngkan.me).

If you have interesting topics, drop me an email at khanhn1462 (at) gmail (dot) com.
